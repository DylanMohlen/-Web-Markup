          Tabú in Leiden offers a unique dining experience with a focus on Latin
          American cuisine. Located just 5 minutes away from popular tourist
          attractions like the Leiden Hortus Botanicus and the iconic Rembrandt
          statue, it’s a convenient spot to visit. Upon entering, you’ll be
          welcomed by the friendly staff and will immediately notice the rustic
          and somewhat different decorations. The menu features a diverse
          selection of dishes, blending international flavours with Latin
          American favourites. Tabú aims to please diners with a fun and
          adventurous approach to food. The restaurant boasts a lovely view of
          the water and offers a charming patio where you can enjoy your meal.
          Definitely worth checking out!

          Paco Ciao, located near Leiden Central Station and several popular
          tourist attractions, offers a charming dining experience in a
          beautifully restored monumental building known as the Crown Villa. The
          restaurant's interior design blends bohemian chic with classic
          elegance, reminiscent of a vintage Latin American courtyard or an
          aristocratic Mexican hacienda. The decor features a mix of vintage
          chairs, marble tables, lush tropical plants, and brass accents, all in
          warm earth tones. For a little surprise, I recommend you press the Red
          Button in the Toilets area. With numerous cozy nooks and stunning
          details, Paco Ciao is visually stunning, making for great Instagram
          photos and stories. The menu caters to all tastes with a range of
          healthy options and not-so-healthy options, ensuring there’s something
          for everyone.
